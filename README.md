# Face Recognition Based Attendance System
It is a face recognition based attendance system with the implementation of opencv and Eigen face & haarcascade classifier algorithm for face recognition.

Initially while developing this project it was challenging about the storage of the images in the system for recognition because i implemented this using the supervised form of machine learning which works over the labelled dataset and the images that i stored in the directory used as the storsge for all of the images in which each image had to be labelled and later the path of this directory was assigned as the path.

When a person is recognised based on the haarcascade and eigen face algorithm it would display the name of the person and also the along with the timestamp being recorded in the csv file and the date on which the person is logged in.

It was implemented mainly because in the educational institutions,workspaces the manual entries and sometimes the RFID card readers also will not provide accurate results it is mainly time saving and really efficient for the use in these above places.
